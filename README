Solutions for PHP test tasks from http://phpixie.com/blog/test-tasks-for-php-interviews-that-developers-will-enjoy-solving/

1) Print an associative array as an ASCII table. E.g you have this array:
	
    array(
        array(
            'Name' => 'Trixie',
            'Color' => 'Green',
            'Element' => 'Earth',
            'Likes' => 'Flowers'
            ),
        array(
            'Name' => 'Tinkerbell',
            'Element' => 'Air',
            'Likes' => 'Singning',
            'Color' => 'Blue'
            ), 
        array(
            'Element' => 'Water',
            'Likes' => 'Dancing',
            'Name' => 'Blum',
            'Color' => 'Pink'
            ),
    );
    
    
    And expect this output:
        
    +------------+-------+---------+---------+
    |    Name    | Color | Element |  Likes  |
    +------------+-------+---------+---------+
    | Trixie     | Green | Earth   | Flowers |
    | Tinkerbell | Blue  | Air     | Singing |
    | Blum       | Pink  | Water   | Dancing |
    +------------+-------+---------+---------+
    
    The position of the elements in each subarray may vary but the keys themselves are always the same. 
    Give extra points if the developer can make Color colum colored depending on the color name 
    (of course you will have to specify a finite list of colors then) and if he substitues the names of the elemnts with 
    the ASCII symbols of the elements.
    
    Most PHP developers dont get much of a chance to work with ASCII interfaces but they see such tables a lot in MySQL 
    for example so it might be interesting for them to try this out. Drawing such a table doesnt require any additional 
    knowledge so it wont be that hard for anyone.
